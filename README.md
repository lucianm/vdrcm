VDR Config Manager - interactive console dialogs script for managing VDR configuration files


For VDR versions close to 2.2.0 and newer, supporting config files placed in the ARGSDIR directory.
The pool of config files for VDR itself and one for each plugin instance are expected to be situated
under /etc/vdr/conf.avail, then vdrcm will link them to /etc/vdr/conf.d.


Depends on dialog or whiptail to display dialogues in the text console.


I will add nicer information a little bit later, till then you can have a look at the Wiki page for
a quick'n dirty visual usage summary:
